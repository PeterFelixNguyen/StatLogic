+ "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,\n"
+ "Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\n"
+ "While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n"
+ "As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n"
+ "`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -\n"
+ "Only this, and nothing more.'\n\n"

+ "Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\n"
+ "And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n"
+ "Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow\n"
+ "From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -\n"
+ "For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -\n"
+ "Nameless here for evermore.\n\n"

+ "And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\n"
+ "Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n"
+ "So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n"
+ "`'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -\n"
+ "Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -\n"
+ "This it is, and nothing more,'\n\n"

+ "Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n"
+ "`Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n"
+ "But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n"
+ "And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\n"
+ "That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -\n"
+ "Darkness there, and nothing more.\n\n"

+ "Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\n"
+ "Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n"
+ "But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\n"
+ "And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!'\n"
+ "This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!'\n"
+ "Merely this and nothing more.\n\n"

+ "Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n"
+ "Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n"
+ "`Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;\n"
+ "Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -\n"
+ "Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -\n"
+ "'Tis the wind and nothing more!'\n\n"

+ "Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\n"
+ "In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.\n"
+ "Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\n"
+ "But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -\n"
+ "Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -\n"
+ "Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\n"

+ "Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\n"
+ "By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n"
+ "`Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven.\n"
+ "Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -\n"
+ "Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'\n"
+ "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'\n\n"

+ "Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\n"
+ "Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;\n"
+ "For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n"
+ "Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -\n"
+ "Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n"
+ "With such name as `Nevermore.'\n\n"

+ "But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,\n"
+ "That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\n"
+ "Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -\n"
+ "Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -\n"
+ "On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'\n"
+ "Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'\n\n"

+ "Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n"
+ "`Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,\n"
+ "Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster\n"
+ "Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -\n"
+ "Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore\n"
+ "Of \"Never-nevermore.\"'\n\n"

+ "But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\n"
+ "Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;\n"
+ "Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n"
+ "Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -\n"
+ "What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n"
+ "Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'\n\n"

+ "This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n"
+ "To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\n"
+ "This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n"
+ "On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\n"
+ "But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,\n"
+ "She shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\n"

+ "Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\n"
+ "Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n"
+ "`Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee\n"
+ "Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!\n"
+ "Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'\n"
+ "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'\n\n"

+ "`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -\n"
+ "Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n"
+ "Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -\n"
+ "On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -\n"
+ "Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'\n"
+ "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'\n\n"

+ "`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!\n"
+ "By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -\n"
+ "Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n"
+ "It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore -\n"
+ "Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?'\n"
+ "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'\n\n"

+ "`Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -\n"
+ "`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\n"
+ "Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\n"
+ "Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!\n"
+ "Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'\n"
+ "Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'\n\n"


+ "And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\n"
+ "On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\n"
+ "And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\n"
+ "And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\n"
+ "And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n"
+ "Shall be lifted - nevermore!\n"
